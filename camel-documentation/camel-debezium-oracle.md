# Debezium-oracle

**Since Camel 3.17**

**Only consumer is supported**

The Debezium oracle component is wrapper around
[Debezium](https://debezium.io/) using [Debezium
Engine](https://debezium.io/documentation/reference/1.9/development/engine.html),
that enables Change Data Capture from the Oracle database using Debezium
without the need for Kafka or Kafka Connect.

**Note on handling failures:** per [Debezium Embedded
Engine](https://debezium.io/documentation/reference/1.9/development/engine.html#_handling_failures)
documentation, the engines are actively recording source offsets and
periodically flush these offsets to a persistent storage. Therefore,
when the application is restarted or crashed, the engine will resume
from the last recorded offset. This means that, at normal operation,
your downstream routes will receive each event exactly once. However, in
case of an application crash (not having a graceful shutdown), the
application will resume from the last recorded offset, which may result
in receiving duplicate events immediately after the restart. Therefore,
your downstream routes should be tolerant enough of such a case and
deduplicate events if needed.

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their `pom.xml`
for this component.

    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
        <artifactId>camel-debezium-oracle</artifactId>
        <version>x.x.x</version>
        <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
    </dependency>

# URI format

[https://debezium.io/documentation/reference/0.10/connectors/oracleql.html#connector-properties](https://debezium.io/documentation/reference/1.18/connectors/oracleql.html#connector-properties)

# Message body

The message body if is not `null` (in case of tombstones), it contains
the state of the row after the event occurred as `Struct` format or
`Map` format if you use the included Type Converter from `Struct` to
`Map`.

Check below for more details.

# Samples

## Consuming events

Here is a basic route that you can use to listen to Debezium events from
oracle connector.

    from("debezium-oracle:dbz-test-1?offsetStorageFileName=/usr/offset-file-1.dat&databaseHostname=localhost&databaseUser=debezium&databasePassword=dbz&databaseServerName=my-app-connector&databaseHistoryFileFilename=/usr/history-file-1.dat")
        .log("Event received from Debezium : ${body}")
        .log("    with this identifier ${headers.CamelDebeziumIdentifier}")
        .log("    with these source metadata ${headers.CamelDebeziumSourceMetadata}")
        .log("    the event occurred upon this operation '${headers.CamelDebeziumSourceOperation}'")
        .log("    on this database '${headers.CamelDebeziumSourceMetadata[db]}' and this table '${headers.CamelDebeziumSourceMetadata[table]}'")
        .log("    with the key ${headers.CamelDebeziumKey}")
        .log("    the previous value is ${headers.CamelDebeziumBefore}")

By default, the component will emit the events in the body and
`CamelDebeziumBefore` header as
[`Struct`](https://kafka.apache.org/22/javadoc/org/apache/kafka/connect/data/Struct.html)
data type, the reasoning behind this, is to perceive the schema
information in case is needed. However, the component as well contains a
[Type Converter](#manual::type-converter.adoc) that converts from
default output type of
[`Struct`](https://kafka.apache.org/22/javadoc/org/apache/kafka/connect/data/Struct.html)
to `Map` in order to leverage Camelâ€™s rich [Data
Format](#manual::data-format.adoc) types which many of them work out of
box with `Map` data type. To use it, you can either add `Map.class` type
when you access the message (e.g.,
`exchange.getIn().getBody(Map.class)`), or you can convert the body
always to `Map` from the route builder by adding
`.convertBodyTo(Map.class)` to your Camel Route DSL after `from`
statement.

We mentioned above the schema, which can be used in case you need to
perform advance data transformation and the schema is needed for that.
If you choose not to convert your body to `Map`, you can obtain the
schema information as
[`Schema`](https://kafka.apache.org/22/javadoc/org/apache/kafka/connect/data/Schema.html)
type from `Struct` like this:

    from("debezium-oracle:[name]?[options]])
        .process(exchange -> {
            final Struct bodyValue = exchange.getIn().getBody(Struct.class);
            final Schema schemaValue = bodyValue.schema();
    
            log.info("Body value is : {}", bodyValue);
            log.info("With Schema : {}", schemaValue);
            log.info("And fields of : {}", schemaValue.fields());
            log.info("Field name has `{}` type", schemaValue.field("name").schema());
        });

This component is a thin wrapper around Debezium Engine as mentioned.
Therefore, before using this component in production, you need to
understand how Debezium works and how configurations can reflect the
expected behavior. This is especially true in regard to [handling
failures](https://debezium.io/documentation/reference/1.9/operations/embedded.html#_handling_failures).

## Component Configurations

  
|Name|Description|Default|Type|
|---|---|---|---|
|additionalProperties|Additional properties for debezium components in case they can't be set directly on the camel configurations (e.g: setting Kafka Connect properties needed by Debezium engine, for example setting KafkaOffsetBackingStore), the properties have to be prefixed with additionalProperties.. E.g: additionalProperties.transactional.id=12345\&additionalProperties.schema.registry.url=http://localhost:8811/avro||object|
|bridgeErrorHandler|Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions (if possible) occurred while the Camel consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. Important: This is only possible if the 3rd party component allows Camel to be alerted if an exception was thrown. Some components handle this internally only, and therefore bridgeErrorHandler is not possible. In other situations we may improve the Camel component to hook into the 3rd party component and make this possible for future releases. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored.|false|boolean|

|schemaHistoryInternalSkipUnparseableDdl|Controls the action Debezium will take when it meets a DDL statement in binlog, that it cannot parse.By default the connector will stop operating but by changing the setting it can ignore the statements which it cannot parse. If skipping is enabled then Debezium can miss metadata changes.|false|boolean|

|snapshotIncludeCollectionList|This setting must be set to specify a list of tables/collections whose snapshot must be taken on creating or restarting the connector.||string|
|snapshotLockingMode|Controls how the connector holds locks on tables while performing the schema snapshot. The default is 'shared', which means the connector will hold a table lock that prevents exclusive table access for just the initial portion of the snapshot while the database schemas and other metadata are being read. The remaining work in a snapshot involves selecting all rows from each table, and this is done using a flashback query that requires no locks. However, in some cases it may be desirable to avoid locks entirely which can be done by specifying 'none'. This mode is only safe to use if no schema changes are happening while the snapshot is taken.|shared|string|
|snapshotLockTimeoutMs|The maximum number of millis to wait for table locks at the beginning of a snapshot. If locks cannot be acquired in this time frame, the snapshot will be aborted. Defaults to 10 seconds|10s|duration|

After the snapshot completes, the connector begins to stream changes from the redo logs.; 'initial' (default): If the connector does not detect any offsets for the logical server name, it runs a snapshot that captures the current full state of the configured tables. After the snapshot completes, the connector begins to stream changes from the redo logs. 'initial\_only': The connector performs a snapshot as it does for the 'initial' option, but after the connector completes the snapshot, it stops, and does not stream changes from the redo logs.; 'schema\_only': If the connector does not detect any offsets for the logical server name, it runs a snapshot that captures only the schema (table structures), but not any table data. After the snapshot completes, the connector begins to stream changes from the redo logs.; 'schema\_only\_recovery': The connector performs a snapshot that captures only the database schema history. The connector then transitions to streaming from the redo logs. Use this setting to restore a corrupted or lost database schema history topic. Do not use if the database schema was modified after the connector stopped.|initial|string|

The implementations must implement the 'Snapshotter' interface and is called on each app boot to determine whether to do a snapshot.||string|
|snapshotSelectStatementOverrides|This property contains a comma-separated list of fully-qualified tables (DB\_NAME.TABLE\_NAME) or (SCHEMA\_NAME.TABLE\_NAME), depending on the specific connectors. Select statements for the individual tables are specified in further configuration properties, one for each table, identified by the id 'snapshot.select.statement.overrides.DB\_NAME.TABLE\_NAME' or 'snapshot.select.statement.overrides.SCHEMA\_NAME.TABLE\_NAME', respectively. The value of those properties is the select statement to use when retrieving data from the specific table during snapshotting. A possible use case for large append-only tables is setting a specific point where to start (resume) snapshotting, in case a previous snapshotting was interrupted.||string|
|snapshotTablesOrderByRowCount|Controls the order in which tables are processed in the initial snapshot. A descending value will order the tables by row count descending. A ascending value will order the tables by row count ascending. A value of disabled (the default) will disable ordering by row count.|disabled|string|
|sourceinfoStructMaker|The name of the SourceInfoStructMaker class that returns SourceInfo schema and struct.|io.debezium.connector.oracle.OracleSourceInfoStructMaker|string|

|tombstonesOnDelete|Whether delete operations should be represented by a delete event and a subsequent tombstone event (true) or only by a delete event (false). Emitting the tombstone event (the default behavior) allows Kafka to completely delete all events pertaining to the given key once the source record got deleted.|false|boolean|
|topicNamingStrategy|The name of the TopicNamingStrategy class that should be used to determine the topic name for data change, schema change, transaction, heartbeat event etc.|io.debezium.schema.SchemaTopicNamingStrategy|string|
|topicPrefix|Topic prefix that identifies and provides a namespace for the particular database server/cluster is capturing changes. The topic prefix should be unique across all other connectors, since it is used as a prefix for all Kafka topic names that receive events emitted by this connector. Only alphanumeric characters, hyphens, dots and underscores must be accepted.||string|
|transactionMetadataFactory|Class to make transaction context \& transaction struct/schemas|io.debezium.pipeline.txmetadata.DefaultTransactionMetadataFactory|string|
|unavailableValuePlaceholder|Specify the constant that will be provided by Debezium to indicate that the original value is unavailable and not provided by the database.|\_\_debezium\_unavailable\_value|string|

The remaining work in a snapshot involves selecting all rows from each table, and this is done using a flashback query that requires no locks. However, in some cases it may be desirable to avoid locks entirely which can be done by specifying 'none'. This mode is only safe to use if no schema changes are happening while the snapshot is taken.|shared|string|

After the snapshot completes, the connector begins to stream changes from the redo logs. 'initial\_only': The connector performs a snapshot as it does for the 'initial' option, but after the connector completes the snapshot, it stops, and does not stream changes from the redo logs.; 'schema\_only': If the connector does not detect any offsets for the logical server name, it runs a snapshot that captures only the schema (table structures), but not any table data. After the snapshot completes, the connector begins to stream changes from the redo logs.; 'schema\_only\_recovery': The connector performs a snapshot that captures only the database schema history. The connector then transitions to streaming from the redo logs. Use this setting to restore a corrupted or lost database schema history topic.

The value of those properties is the select statement to use when retrieving data from the specific table during snapshotting. A possible use case for large append-only tables is setting a specific point where to start (resume) snapshotting, in case a previous snapshotting was interrupted.||string|
|snapshotTablesOrderByRowCount|Controls the order in which tables are processed in the initial snapshot. A descending value will order the tables by row count descending.
