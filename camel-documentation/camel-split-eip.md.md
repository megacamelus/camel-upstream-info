# Split-eip.md

How can we process a message if it contains multiple elements, each of
which may have to be processed in a different way?

Use a Splitter to break out the composite message into a series of
individual messages, each containing data related to one item.

The
[Splitter](http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/patterns/messaging/Sequencer.html)
from the [EIP patterns](#enterprise-integration-patterns.adoc) allows
you to split a message into a number of pieces and process them
individually.

# Using Split

The following example shows how to take a request from the `direct:a`
endpoint, then split into sub messages, which each are sent to the
`direct:b` endpoint.

The example splits the message body using a tokenizer to split into
lines using the new-line character as separator.

    from("direct:a")
        .split(body().tokenize("\n"))
            .to("direct:b");

And in XML:

    <route>
      <from uri="direct:a"/>
      <split>
        <tokenize token="\n"/>
        <to uri="direct:b"/>
      </split>
    </route>

The Split EIP has special support for splitting using a delimiter,
instead of using
[Tokenize](#components:languages:tokenize-language.adoc) language.

The previous example can also be done as follows:

    from("direct:a")
        .split(body()).delimiter("\n")
            .to("direct:b");

And in XML:

    <route>
      <from uri="direct:a"/>
      <split delimiter="\n">
        <simple>${body}</simple>
        <to uri="direct:b"/>
      </split>
    </route>

The splitter can use any [Expression](#manual:ROOT:expression.adoc), so
you could use any of the supported languages such as
[Simple](#components:languages:simple-language.adoc),
[XPath](#components:languages:xpath-language.adoc),
[JSonPath](#components:languages:jsonpath-language.adoc),
[Groovy](#components:languages:groovy-language.adoc) to perform the
split.

Java  
from("activemq:my.queue")
.split(xpath("//foo/bar"))
.to("file:some/directory")

XML  
<route>  
<from uri="activemq:my.queue"/>  
<split>  
<xpath>//foo/bar</xpath>  
<to uri="file:some/directory"/>  
</split>  
</route>

## Splitting the message body

A common use case is to split a list/set/collection/map, array, or
something that is iterable from the message body.

The Split EIP will by default split the message body based on the value
type:

-   `java.util.Collection`: splits by each element from the
    collection/list/set.

-   `java.util.Map`: splits by each `Map.Entry` from the map.

-   `Object[]`: splits the array by each element

-   `Iterator`: splits by the iterator

-   `Iterable`: splits by the iterable

-   `org.w3c.dom.NodeList`: splits the XML document by each element from
    the list

-   `String`: splits the string value by comma as separator

For any other type, the message body is not split, and instead used
*as-is*, meaning that the Split EIP will be split into a single message
(the same).

To use this with the splitter, you should *just* use body as the
expression:

Java  
from("direct:splitUsingBody")
.split(body())
.to("mock:result");

XML  
In XML, you use [Simple](#components:languages:simple-language.adoc) to
refer to the message body:

    <route>
      <from uri="direct:splitUsingBody"/>
      <split>
         <simple>${body}</simple>
         <to uri="mock:result"/>
      </split>
    </route>

## Splitting with parallel processing

You can enable parallel processing with Split EIP so each split message
is processed by its own thread in parallel.

The example below enabled parallel mode:

Java  
from("direct:a")
.split(body()).parallelProcessing()
.to("direct:x")
.to("direct:y")
.to("direct:z");

XML  
<route>  
<from uri="direct:a"/>  
<split parallelProcessing="true">  
<simple>${body}</simple>  
<to uri="direct:b"/>  
<to uri="direct:c"/>  
<to uri="direct:d"/>  
</split>  
</route>

When parallel processing is enabled, then the Camel routing engin will
continue processing using last used thread from the parallel thread
pool. However, if you want to use the original thread that called the
splitter, then make sure to enable the synchronous option as well.

## Ending a Split block

You may want to continue routing the exchange after the Split EIP. In
Java DSL you need to use `end()` to mark where split ends, and where
other EIPs can be added to continue the route.

In the example above then sending to mock:result happens after the Split
EIP has finished. In other words, the message should finish splitting
the entire message before the message continues.

Java  
from("direct:a")
.split(body()).parallelProcessing()
.to("direct:x")
.to("direct:y")
.to("direct:z")
.end()
.to("mock:result");

XML  
And in XML its intuitive as `</split>` marks the end of the block:

    <route>
        <from uri="direct:a"/>
        <split parallelProcessing="true">
            <simple>${body}</simple>
            <to uri="direct:b"/>
            <to uri="direct:c"/>
            <to uri="direct:d"/>
        </split>
        <to uri="mock:result"/>
    </route>

## What is returned from Split EIP when its complete

The Splitter will by default return the original input message.

You can control this by using a custom `AggregationStrategy`.

## Aggregating

The `AggregationStrategy` is used for aggregating all the split
exchanges together as a single response exchange, that becomes the
outgoing exchange after the Split EIP block.

The example now aggregates with the `MyAggregationStrategy` class:

Java  
from("direct:start")
.split(body(), new MyAggregationStrategy())
.to("direct:x")
.to("direct:y")
.to("direct:z")
.end()
.to("mock:result");

XML  
And in XML we can refer to the FQN class name with `#class:` syntax as
shown below:

    <route>
        <from uri="direct:a"/>
        <split aggregationStrategy="#class:com.foo.MyAggregationStrategy">
            <simple>${body}</simple>
            <to uri="direct:b"/>
            <to uri="direct:c"/>
            <to uri="direct:d"/>
        </split>
        <to uri="mock:result"/>
    </route>

The Multicast, Recipient List, and Splitter EIPs have special support
for using `AggregationStrategy` with access to the original input
exchange. You may want to use this when you aggregate messages and there
has been a failure in one of the messages, which you then want to enrich
on the original input message and return as response; itâ€™s the aggregate
method with 3 exchange parameters.

## Splitting modes

The Split EIP operates in two modes when splitting:

-   *default mode*: The message is split into sub messages, which allows
    to know the total split size. However, this causes all sub messages
    to be kept temporary in-memory.

-   *streaming mode*: The message is split on-demand. This uses an
    iterator to keep track of the splitting index, but avoids loading
    all sub messages into memory. However, the total size cannot be
    known ahead of time.

## Using streaming mode

You can split in streaming mode as shown:

Java  
from("direct:streaming")
.split(body().tokenize(",")).streaming()
.to("activemq:my.parts");

XML  
<route>  
<from uri="direct:streaming"/>  
<split streaming="true">  
<tokenize token=","/>  
<to uri="activemq:my.parts"/>  
</split>  
</route>

You can also supply a custom
[Bean](#components:languages:bean-language.adoc) to perform the
splitting in streaming mode like this:

Java  
from("direct:streaming")
.split(method(new MyCustomSplitter(), "splitMe")).streaming()
.to("activemq:my.parts")

XML  
<route>  
<from uri="direct:streaming"/>  
<split streaming="true">  
<method ref="#class:com.foo.MyCustomSplitter" method="splitMe"/>  
<to uri="activemq:my.parts"/>  
</split>  
</route>

Then the custom bean could, for example, be implemented as follows:

    public class MyCustomSplitter {
    
        public List splitMe(Exchange exchange) {
            Object body = exchange.getMessage().getBody();
    
            List answer = new ArrayList();
            // split the message body how you like
            return answer;
        }
    }

The bean should just return something that the splitter can work with
when splitting, such as a `List` or `Iterator` etc.

The bean method `splitMe` uses `Exchange` as parameter, however, Camel
supports [Bean Parameter Binding](#manual:ROOT:bean-binding.adoc), which
allows using other parameters types instead.

## Streaming big XML payloads

**Splitting big XML payloads**

The XPath engine in Java and Saxon will load the entire XML content into
memory. And thus they are not well suited for very big XML payloads.
Instead, you can use a custom Expression which will iterate the XML
payload in a streamed fashion. You can use the Tokenizer language which
supports this when you supply the start and end tokens. You can use the
XMLTokenizer language which is specifically provided for tokenizing XML
documents.

There are two tokenizers that can be used to tokenize an XML payload:

-   [Tokenize](#components:languages:tokenize-language.adoc) language

-   [XML Tokenize](#components:languages:xtokenize-language.adoc)
    language

## Streaming big XML payloads using Tokenize language

The first tokenizer uses the same principle as in the text tokenizer to
scan the XML payload and extract a sequence of tokens. If you have a big
XML payload, from a file source, and want to split it in streaming mode,
then you can use the
[Tokenize](#components:languages:tokenize-language.adoc) language with
start/end tokens to do this with low memory footprint.

**StAX component**

The Camel StAX component can also be used to split big XML files in a
streaming mode. See more details at
[StAX](#components::stax-component.adoc).

For example, you may have an XML payload structured as follows:

    <orders>
      <order>
        <!-- order stuff here -->
      </order>
      <order>
        <!-- order stuff here -->
      </order>
    ...
      <order>
        <!-- order stuff here -->
      </order>
    </orders>

Now to split this big file using
[XPath](#components:languages:xpath-language.adoc) would cause the
entire content to be loaded into memory. So instead, we can use the
[Tokenize](#components:languages:tokenize-language.adoc) language to do
this as follows:

Java  
from("file:inbox")
.split().tokenizeXML("order").streaming()
.to("activemq:queue:order");

XML  
<route>  
<from uri="file:inbox"/>  
<split streaming="true">  
<tokenize token="order" xml="true"/>  
<to uri="activemq:queue:order"/>  
</split>  
</route>

This will split the file using the tag name of the child nodes (more
precisely speaking, the local name of the element without its namespace
prefix if any), which mean it will grab the content between the
`<order>` and `</order>` tags (incl. the tags).

So for example, a split message would be structured as follows:

    <order>
      <!-- order stuff here -->
    </order>

If you want to inherit namespaces from a root/parent tag, then you can
do this as well by providing the name of the root/parent tag:

Java  
from("file:inbox")
.split().tokenizeXML("order", "orders").streaming()
.to("activemq:queue:order");

XML  
<route>  
<from uri="file:inbox"/>  
<split streaming="true">  
<tokenize token="order" inheritNamespaceTagName="orders" xml="true"/>  
<to uri="activemq:queue:order"/>  
</split>  
</route>

You can set `inheritNamsepaceTagName` property to `*` to include the
preceding context in each token (i.e., generating each token enclosed in
its ancestor elements). It is noted that each token must share the same
ancestor elements in this case. The above tokenizer works well on simple
structures but has some inherent limitations in handling more complex
XML structures.

## Streaming big XML payloads using XML Tokenize language

The second tokenizer ([XML
Tokenize](#components:languages:xtokenize-language.adoc)) uses a StAX
parser to overcome these limitations. This tokenizer recognizes XML
namespaces and also handles simple and complex XML structures more
naturally and efficiently.

To split with XML namespaces on a tag with a local namespace such as
`{urn:shop}order`, we can write:

    Namespaces ns = new Namespaces("ns1", "urn:shop");
    
    from("file:inbox")
      .split().xtokenize("//ns1:order", 'i', ns).streaming()
        .to("activemq:queue:order)

Two arguments control the behavior of the tokenizer:

1.  The first argument specifies the element using a path notation This
    path notation uses a subset of xpath with wildcard support.

2.  The second argument represents the extraction mode.

The available extraction modes are:

<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 33%" />
<col style="width: 66%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr>
<th style="text-align: left;">Mode</th>
<th style="text-align: left;">Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;"><p>i</p></td>
<td style="text-align: left;"><p>injecting the contextual namespace
bindings into the extracted token (default)</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;"><p>w</p></td>
<td style="text-align: left;"><p>wrapping the extracted token in its
ancestor context</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;"><p>u</p></td>
<td style="text-align: left;"><p>unwrapping the extracted token to its
child content</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;"><p>t</p></td>
<td style="text-align: left;"><p>extracting the text content of the
specified element</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Having an input XML:

    <m:orders xmlns:m="urn:shop" xmlns:cat="urn:shop:catalog">
      <m:order><id>123</id><date>2014-02-25</date>...</m:order>
    ...
    </m:orders>

Each mode will result in the following tokens:

<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 33%" />
<col style="width: 66%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr>
<th style="text-align: left;">Mode</th>
<th style="text-align: left;">Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;"><p>i</p></td>
<td style="text-align: left;"><p>&lt;m:order xmlns:m="urn:shop"
xmlns:cat="urn:shop:catalog"&gt;&lt;id&gt;123&lt;/id&gt;&lt;date&gt;2014-02-25&lt;/date&gt;â€¦&lt;/m:order&gt;</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;"><p>w</p></td>
<td style="text-align: left;"><p>&lt;m:orders xmlns:m="urn:shop"
xmlns:cat="urn:shop:catalog"&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;m:order&gt;&lt;id&gt;123&lt;/id&gt;&lt;date&gt;2014-02-25&lt;/date&gt;â€¦&lt;/m:order&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;/m:orders&gt;</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;"><p>u</p></td>
<td
style="text-align: left;"><p>&lt;id&gt;123&lt;/id&gt;&lt;date&gt;2014-02-25&lt;/date&gt;â€¦</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;"><p>t</p></td>
<td style="text-align: left;"><p>1232014-02-25â€¦</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

In XML, the equivalent route would be written as follows:

    <camelContext xmlns:ns1="urn:shop">
      <route>
        <from uri="file:inbox"/>
        <split streaming="true">
          <xtokenize>//ns1:order</xtokenize>
          <to uri="activemq:queue:order"/>
        </split>
      </route>
    </camelContext>

or setting the extraction mode explicitly as

    <xtokenize mode="i">//ns1:order</xtokenize>

Note that this StAX based tokenizer uses StAX Location API and requires
a StAX Reader implementation (such as Woodstox) that correctly returns
the offset position pointing to the beginning of each event triggering
segment (the offset position of `<` at each start and end element
event). If you use a StAX Reader which does not implement that API
correctly, it results in invalid XML snippets after the split.

For example, the snippet could be wrongly terminated:

    <Start>...<</Start> .... <Start>...</</Start>

## Splitting files by grouping N lines together

The [Tokenize](#components:languages:tokenize-language.adoc) language
can be used for grouping N parts together, for example, to split big
files into chunks of 1000 lines.

Doing this is easy as the following example shows:

Java  
from("file:inbox")
.split().tokenize("\\n", 1000).streaming()
.to("activemq:queue:order");

XML  
<route>  
<from uri="file:inbox"/>  
<split streaming="true">  
<tokenize token="\n" group="1000"/>  
<to uri="activemq:queue:order"/>  
</split>  
</route>

The `group` value must be a positive number dictating how many elements
to combine in a group. Each part will be combined using the token.

In the example above, the message being sent to the activemq order
queue, will contain 1000 lines, and each line separated by the token
(which is a new line token).

The output when using the group option is always a `java.lang.String`
type.

## Split and aggregate example

This sample shows how you can split an Exchange, process each split
message, aggregate and return a combined response to the original
caller.

The route below illustrates this and how the split supports a custom
`AggregationStrategy` to build up the combined response message.

    // this routes starts from the direct:start endpoint
    // the body is then split based on @ separator
    // the splitter in Camel supports InOut as well, and for that we need
    // to be able to aggregate what response we need to send back, so we provide our
    // own strategy with the class MyOrderStrategy.
    from("direct:start")
        .split(body().tokenize("@"), new MyOrderStrategy())
            // each split message is then send to this bean where we can process it
            .to("bean:MyOrderService?method=handleOrder")
            // this is important to end the splitter route as we do not want to do more routing
            // on each split message
        .end()
        // after we have split and handled each message, we want to send a single combined
        // response back to the original caller, so we let this bean build it for us,
        // this bean will receive the result of the aggregate strategy: MyOrderStrategy
        .to("bean:MyOrderService?method=buildCombinedResponse")

And the OrderService bean is as follows:

    public static class MyOrderService {
    
        private static int counter;
    
        /**
         * We just handle the order by returning an id line for the order
         */
        public String handleOrder(String line) {
            LOG.debug("HandleOrder: {}", line);
            return "(id=" + ++counter + ",item=" + line + ")";
        }
    
        /**
         * We use the same bean for building the combined response to send
         * back to the original caller
         */
        public String buildCombinedResponse(String line) {
            LOG.debug("BuildCombinedResponse: {}", line);
            return "Response[" + line + "]";
        }
    }

And our custom `AggregationStrategy` that is responsible for holding the
in progress aggregated message that after the splitter is ended will be
sent to the `buildCombinedResponse` method for final processing before
the combined response can be returned to the waiting caller.

    /**
     * This is our own order aggregation strategy where we can control
     * how each split message should be combined. As we do not want to
     * loos any message we copy from the new to the old to preserve the
     * order lines as we process them
     */
    public static class MyOrderStrategy implements AggregationStrategy {
    
        public Exchange aggregate(Exchange oldExchange, Exchange newExchange) {
            // put order together in old exchange by adding the order from new exchange
    
            if (oldExchange == null) {
                // the first time we aggregate we only have the new exchange,
                // so we just return it
                return newExchange;
            }
    
            String orders = oldExchange.getIn().getBody(String.class);
            String newLine = newExchange.getIn().getBody(String.class);
    
            LOG.debug("Aggregate old orders: {}", orders);
            LOG.debug("Aggregate new order: {}", newLine);
    
            // put orders together separating by semicolon
            orders = orders + ";" + newLine;
            // put combined order back on old to preserve it
            oldExchange.getIn().setBody(orders);
    
            // return old as this is the one that has all the orders gathered until now
            return oldExchange;
        }
    }

So letâ€™s run the sample and see how it works.

We send an Exchange to the direct:start endpoint containing a message
body with the String value: `A@B@C`. The flow is:

    HandleOrder: A
    HandleOrder: B
    Aggregate old orders: (id=1,item=A)
    Aggregate new order: (id=2,item=B)
    HandleOrder: C
    Aggregate old orders: (id=1,item=A);(id=2,item=B)
    Aggregate new order: (id=3,item=C)
    BuildCombinedResponse: (id=1,item=A);(id=2,item=B);(id=3,item=C)
    Response to caller: Response[(id=1,item=A);(id=2,item=B);(id=3,item=C)]

## Stop processing in case of exception

The Splitter will by default continue to process the entire Exchange
even in case of one of the split messages will throw an exception during
routing.

For example, if you have an Exchange with 1000 rows that you split.
During processing of these split messages, an exception is thrown at the
17th. What Camel does by default is to process the remainder of the 983
messages. You have the chance to deal with the exception when
aggregating using an `AggregationStrategy`.

But sometimes you want Apache Camel to stop and let the exception be
propagated back, and let the Camel [Error
Handler](#manual:ROOT:error-handler.adoc) handle it. You can do this by
specifying that it should stop in case of an exception occurred. This is
done by the `stopOnException` option as shown below:

Java  
from("direct:start")
.split(body().tokenize(",")).stopOnException()
.process(new MyProcessor())
.to("mock:split")
.end()
.to("direct:cheese");

XML  
<route>  
<from uri="direct:start"/>  
<split stopOnException="true">  
<tokenize token=","/>  
<process ref="myProcessor"/>  
<to uri="mock:split"/>  
</split>  
<to uri="direct:cheese"/>  
</route>

In the example above, then `MyProcessor` is causing a failure and throws
an exception. This means the Split EIP will stop after this, and not
split anymore.

## Sharing unit of work

The Splitter will by default not share unit of work between the parent
exchange and each split exchange. This means each sub exchange has its
own individual unit of work.

For example, you need to split a big message, and regard that process as
an atomic-isolated operation that either is a success or failure. In
case of a failure, you want that big message to be moved into a dead
letter queue.

To support this use case, you would have to share the unit of work on
the Splitter.

Here is an example in Java DSL:

    errorHandler(deadLetterChannel("mock:dead").useOriginalMessage()
            .maximumRedeliveries(3).redeliveryDelay(0));
    
    from("direct:start")
        .to("mock:a")
        // share unit of work in the splitter, which tells Camel to propagate failures from
        // processing the split messages back to the result of the splitter, which allows
        // it to act as a combined unit of work
        .split(body().tokenize(",")).shareUnitOfWork()
            .to("mock:b")
            .to("direct:line")
        .end()
        .to("mock:result");
    
    from("direct:line")
        .to("log:line")
        .process(new MyProcessor())
        .to("mock:line");

What would happen is that in case there is an exception thrown during
splitting, then the error handler will kick in (yes error handling still
applies for the sub messages).

The error handler in this example is configured to retry up till three
times. And when a split message fails all redelivery attempts (its
exhausted), then this message is **not** moved into that dead letter
queue.

The reason is that we have shared the unit of work, so the split message
will report the error on the shared unit of work. When the Splitter is
done, it checks the state of the shared unit of work and checks if any
errors occurred. If an error occurred it will set the exception on the
`Exchange` and mark it for rollback.

The error handler will yet again kick in, as the `Exchange` has been
marked as rollback. No redelivery attempts are performed (as it was
marked for rollback) and the `Exchange` will be moved into the dead
letter queue.

Using this from XML DSL is just as easy as all you have to set is the
`shareUnitOfWork`:

    <camelContext errorHandlerRef="dlc" xmlns="http://camel.apache.org/schema/spring">
    
      <!-- define error handler as DLC, with use original message enabled -->
      <errorHandler id="dlc" type="DeadLetterChannel" deadLetterUri="mock:dead" useOriginalMessage="true">
        <redeliveryPolicy maximumRedeliveries="3" redeliveryDelay="0"/>
      </errorHandler>
    
      <route>
        <from uri="direct:start"/>
        <to uri="mock:a"/>
        <!-- share unit of work in the splitter, which tells Camel to propagate failures from
             processing the split messages back to the result of the splitter, which allows
             it to act as a combined unit of work -->
        <split shareUnitOfWork="true">
          <tokenize token=","/>
          <to uri="mock:b"/>
          <to uri="direct:line"/>
        </split>
        <to uri="mock:result"/>
      </route>
    
      <!-- route for processing each split line -->
      <route>
        <from uri="direct:line"/>
        <to uri="log:line"/>
        <process ref="myProcessor"/>
        <to uri="mock:line"/>
      </route>
    
    </camelContext>

[Recipient List](#recipientList-eip.adoc) and Split EIPs, then you can
find more information in those EIPs about features that are also
available with Split EIP.
