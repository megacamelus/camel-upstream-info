# Jcr

**Since Camel 1.3**

**Both producer and consumer are supported**

The JCR component allows you to add/read nodes to/from a JCR compliant
content repository, for example, [Apache
Jackrabbit](http://jackrabbit.apache.org/), with its producer, or
register an EventListener with the consumer.

You can use consumer as an EventListener in JCR or a producer to read a
node by identifier.

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their `pom.xml`
for this component:

    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
        <artifactId>camel-jcr</artifactId>
        <version>x.x.x</version>
        <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
    </dependency>

# URI format

    jcr://user:password@repository/path/to/node

The `repository` element of the URI is used to look up the JCR
`Repository` object in the Camel context registry.

# Example

The snippet below creates a node named `node` under the `/home/test`
node in the content repository. One additional property is added to the
node as well: `my.contents.property` which will contain the body of the
message being sent.

    from("direct:a").setHeader(JcrConstants.JCR_NODE_NAME, constant("node"))
        .setHeader("my.contents.property", body())
        .to("jcr://user:pass@repository/home/test");

The following code will register an EventListener under the path
import-application/inbox for `Event.NODE_ADDED` and `Event.NODE_REMOVED`
events (event types 1 and 2, both masked as 3) and listening deep for
all the children.

    <route>
        <from uri="jcr://user:pass@repository/import-application/inbox?eventTypes=3&deep=true" />
        <to uri="direct:execute-import-application" />
    </route>

## Component Configurations

  
|Name|Description|Default|Type|
|---|---|---|---|
|bridgeErrorHandler|Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions (if possible) occurred while the Camel consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. Important: This is only possible if the 3rd party component allows Camel to be alerted if an exception was thrown. Some components handle this internally only, and therefore bridgeErrorHandler is not possible. In other situations we may improve the Camel component to hook into the 3rd party component and make this possible for future releases. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored.|false|boolean|
|lazyStartProducer|Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing.|false|boolean|
|autowiredEnabled|Whether autowiring is enabled. This is used for automatic autowiring options (the option must be marked as autowired) by looking up in the registry to find if there is a single instance of matching type, which then gets configured on the component. This can be used for automatic configuring JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, etc.|true|boolean|

## Endpoint Configurations

  
|Name|Description|Default|Type|
|---|---|---|---|
|host|Name of the javax.jcr.Repository to lookup from the Camel registry to be used.||string|
|base|Get the base node when accessing the repository||string|
|deep|When isDeep is true, events whose associated parent node is at absPath or within its subgraph are received.|false|boolean|
|eventTypes|eventTypes (a combination of one or more event types encoded as a bit mask value such as javax.jcr.observation.Event.NODE\_ADDED, javax.jcr.observation.Event.NODE\_REMOVED, etc.).||integer|
|nodeTypeNames|When a comma separated nodeTypeName list string is set, only events whose associated parent node has one of the node types (or a subtype of one of the node types) in this list will be received.||string|
|noLocal|If noLocal is true, then events generated by the session through which the listener was registered are ignored. Otherwise, they are not ignored.|false|boolean|
|password|Password for login||string|
|sessionLiveCheckInterval|Interval in milliseconds to wait before each session live checking The default value is 60000 ms.|60000|duration|
|sessionLiveCheckIntervalOnStart|Interval in milliseconds to wait before the first session live checking. The default value is 3000 ms.|3000|duration|
|username|Username for login||string|
|uuids|When a comma separated uuid list string is set, only events whose associated parent node has one of the identifiers in the comma separated uuid list will be received.||string|
|workspaceName|The workspace to access. If it's not specified then the default one will be used||string|
|bridgeErrorHandler|Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions (if possible) occurred while the Camel consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler.

By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored.|false|boolean|
|exceptionHandler|To let the consumer use a custom ExceptionHandler. Notice if the option bridgeErrorHandler is enabled then this option is not in use. By default the consumer will deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored.||object|
|exchangePattern|Sets the exchange pattern when the consumer creates an exchange.||object|
|lazyStartProducer|Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message).
