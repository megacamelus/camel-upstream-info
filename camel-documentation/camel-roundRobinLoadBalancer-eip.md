# RoundRobinLoadBalancer-eip.md

Round Robin mode for the [Load Balancer](#loadBalance-eip.adoc) EIP.

The exchanges are selected in a round-robin fashion. This is a well
known and classic policy, which spreads the load evenly.

# Example

We want to load balance between three endpoints in round-robin mode.

This is done as follows in Java DSL:

    from("direct:start")
        .loadBalance().roundRobin()
            .to("seda:x")
            .to("seda:y")
            .to("seda:z")
        .end();

In XML, youâ€™ll have a route like this:

    <route>
        <from uri="direct:start"/>
        <loadBalance>
           <roundRobinLoadBalancer/>
           <to uri="seda:x"/>
           <to uri="seda:y"/>
           <to uri="seda:z"/>
        </loadBalance>
    </route>
