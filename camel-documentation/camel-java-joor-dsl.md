# Java-joor-dsl.md

**Since Camel 3.9**

The `java-joor-dsl` is used for runtime compiling Java routes in an
existing running Camel integration. This was invented for Camel K and
later ported to Apache Camel.

This means that Camel will load the `.java` source during startup and
compile this to Java byte code as `.class`, which then are loaded via
class loader and behaves as regular Java compiled routes.

# Example

The following `MyRoute.java` source file:

**MyRoute.java**

    import org.apache.camel.builder.RouteBuilder;
    
    public class MyRoute extends RouteBuilder {
    
        @Override
        public void configure() throws Exception {
            from("timer:tick")
                .setBody()
                    .constant("Hello Camel K!")
                .to("log:info");
        }
    }

Can then be loaded and run with Camel CLI or Camel K.

**Running with Camel K**

    kamel run MyRoute.java

**Running with Camel CLI**

    camel run MyRoute.java
