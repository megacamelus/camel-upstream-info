# Microprofile-config.md

**Since Camel 3.0**

The microprofile-config component is used for bridging the Eclipse
MicroProfile Config with the Properties Component. This allows using
configuration management from Eclipse MicroProfile with Camel.

To enable this, add this component to the classpath and Camel should
auto-detect this when starting up.

# Usage

## Register manually

You can also register the microprofile-config component manually with
the Apache Camel Properties Component as shown below:

        PropertiesComponent pc = (PropertiesComponent) camelContext.getPropertiesComponent();
        pc.addPropertiesSource(new CamelMicroProfilePropertiesSource());
