# Kamelet-main.md

**Since Camel 3.11**

A `main` class that is opinionated to boostrap and run Camel standalone
with Kamelets (or plain YAML routes) for development and demo purposes.

# Initial configuration

The `KameletMain` is pre-configured with the following properties:

    camel.component.kamelet.location = classpath:kamelets,github:apache:camel-kamelets/kamelets
    camel.component.rest.consumerComponentName = platform-http
    camel.component.rest.producerComponentName = vertx-http
    camel.main.jmxUpdateRouteEnabled = true

These settings can be overridden by configuration in
`application.properties`.

# Automatic dependencies downloading

The Kamelet Main can automatically download Kamelet YAML files from a
remote location over http/https, and from github as well.

The official Kamelets from the Apache Camel Kamelet Catalog is stored on
github and they can be used out of the box as-is.

For example a Camel route can be *coded* in YAML which uses the
Earthquake Kamelet from the catalog, as shown below:

    - route:
        from: "kamelet:earthquake-source"
        steps:
          - unmarshal:
              json: {}
          - log: "Earthquake with magnitude ${body[properties][mag]} at ${body[properties][place]}"

In this use-case the earthquake kamelet will be downloaded from github,
and as well its required dependencies.

You can find an example with this at
[kamelet-main](https://github.com/apache/camel-examples/tree/main/kamelet-main).
