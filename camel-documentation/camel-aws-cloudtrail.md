# Aws-cloudtrail

**Since Camel 3.19**

**Only consumer is supported**

The AWS Cloudtrail component supports receiving events from Amazon
Cloudtrail service.

Prerequisites

You must have a valid Amazon Web Services developer account, and be
signed up to use Amazon Cloudtrail. More information is available at
[AWS Cloudtrail](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/)

# URI Format

    aws-cloudtrail://label[?options]

The stream needs to be created prior to it being used.

You can append query options to the URI in the following format:

`?options=value&option2=value&...`

# Usage

## Static credentials, Default Credential Provider and Profile Credentials Provider

You have the possibility of avoiding the usage of explicit static
credentials by specifying the useDefaultCredentialsProvider option and
set it to true.

The order of evaluation for Default Credentials Provider is the
following:

-   Java system properties - `aws.accessKeyId` and `aws.secretKey`.

-   Environment variables - `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and
    `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`.

-   Web Identity Token from AWS STS.

-   The shared credentials and config files.

-   Amazon ECS container credentials - loaded from the Amazon ECS if the
    environment variable `AWS_CONTAINER_CREDENTIALS_RELATIVE_URI` is
    set.

-   Amazon EC2 Instance profile credentials.

You have also the possibility of using Profile Credentials Provider, by
specifying the useProfileCredentialsProvider option to true and
profileCredentialsName to the profile name.

Only one of static, default and profile credentials could be used at the
same time.

For more information about this you can look at [AWS credentials
documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/latest/developer-guide/credentials.html)

## Cloudtrail Events consumed

The Cloudtrail consumer will use an API method called LookupEvents.

This method will only take into account management events like
create/update/delete of resources and Cloudtrail insight events where
enabled.

This means you wonâ€™t consume the events registered in the Cloudtrail
logs stored on S3, in case of creation of a new Trail.

This is important to notice, and it must be taken into account when
using this component.

## Component Configurations

  
|Name|Description|Default|Type|
|---|---|---|---|
|bridgeErrorHandler|Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions (if possible) occurred while the Camel consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. Important: This is only possible if the 3rd party component allows Camel to be alerted if an exception was thrown. Some components handle this internally only, and therefore bridgeErrorHandler is not possible. In other situations we may improve the Camel component to hook into the 3rd party component and make this possible for future releases. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored.|false|boolean|
|configuration|Component configuration||object|
|eventSource|Specify an event source to select events||string|
|maxResults|Maximum number of records that will be fetched in each poll|1|integer|
|overrideEndpoint|Set the need for overriding the endpoint. This option needs to be used in combination with uriEndpointOverride option|false|boolean|
|region|The region in which Cloudtrail client needs to work. When using this parameter, the configuration will expect the lowercase name of the region (for example ap-east-1) You'll need to use the name Region.EU\_WEST\_1.id()||string|
|uriEndpointOverride|Set the overriding uri endpoint. This option needs to be used in combination with overrideEndpoint option||string|
|autowiredEnabled|Whether autowiring is enabled. This is used for automatic autowiring options (the option must be marked as autowired) by looking up in the registry to find if there is a single instance of matching type, which then gets configured on the component. This can be used for automatic configuring JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, etc.|true|boolean|
|cloudTrailClient|Amazon Cloudtrail client to use for all requests for this endpoint||object|
|healthCheckConsumerEnabled|Used for enabling or disabling all consumer based health checks from this component|true|boolean|
|healthCheckProducerEnabled|Used for enabling or disabling all producer based health checks from this component. Notice: Camel has by default disabled all producer based health-checks. You can turn on producer checks globally by setting camel.health.producersEnabled=true.|true|boolean|
|proxyHost|To define a proxy host when instantiating the Cloudtrail client||string|
|proxyPort|To define a proxy port when instantiating the Cloudtrail client||integer|

|profileCredentialsName|If using a profile credentials provider this parameter will set the profile name.||string|
|secretKey|Amazon AWS Secret Key||string|
|sessionToken|Amazon AWS Session Token used when the user needs to assume a IAM role||string|
|trustAllCertificates|If we want to trust all certificates in case of overriding the endpoint|false|boolean|
|useDefaultCredentialsProvider|Set whether the Cloudtrail client should expect to load credentials through a default credentials provider or to expect static credentials to be passed in.|false|boolean|
|useProfileCredentialsProvider|Set whether the Cloudtrail client should expect to load credentials through a profile credentials provider.|false|boolean|
|useSessionCredentials|Set whether the CloudTrail client should expect to use Session Credentials. This is useful in situation in which the user needs to assume a IAM role for doing operations in CloudTrail.|false|boolean|
