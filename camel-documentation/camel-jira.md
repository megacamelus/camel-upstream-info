# Jira

**Since Camel 3.0**

**Both producer and consumer are supported**

The JIRA component interacts with the JIRA API by encapsulating
Atlassian’s [REST Java Client for
JIRA](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/jira-rest-java-client/src/master/).
It currently provides polling for new issues and new comments. It is
also able to create new issues, add comments, change issues, add/remove
watchers, add attachment and transition the state of an issue.

Rather than webhooks, this endpoint relies on simple polling. Reasons
include:

-   Concern for reliability/stability

-   The types of payloads we’re polling aren’t typically large (plus,
    paging is available in the API)

-   The need to support apps running somewhere not publicly accessible
    where a webhook would fail

Note that the JIRA API is fairly expansive. Therefore, this component
could be easily expanded to provide additional interactions.

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their pom.xml
for this component:

    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
        <artifactId>camel-jira</artifactId>
        <version>${camel-version}</version>
    </dependency>

Atlassian does not release their JIRA Java client to Maven Central.
Therefore, when using `camel-jira` then the `pom.xml` has included Maven
repository to the following URL:
`https://packages.atlassian.com/maven-external`.

Keep this in mind as Maven will then use this repository to download the
JIRA client (and potentially other JARs). Which allows Atlassian to
track these downloads by their servers.

# URI format

    jira://type[?options]

The Jira type accepts the following operations:

For consumers:

-   newIssues: retrieve only new issues after the route is started

-   newComments: retrieve only new comments after the route is started

-   watchUpdates: retrieve only updated fields/issues based on provided
    jql

For producers:

-   addIssue: add an issue

-   addComment: add a comment on a given issue

-   attach: add an attachment on a given issue

-   deleteIssue: delete a given issue

-   updateIssue: update fields of a given issue

-   transitionIssue: transition a status of a given issue

-   watchers: add/remove watchers of a given issue

As Jira is fully customizable, you must ensure the field IDs exist for
the project and workflow, as they can change between different Jira
servers.

# Usage

## Client Factory

You can bind the `JiraRestClientFactory` with name
**JiraRestClientFactory** in the registry to have it automatically set
in the Jira endpoint.

## Authentication

Camel-jira supports the following forms of authentication:

-   [Basic
    Authentication](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-rest-api-basic-authentication/)

-   [OAuth 3 legged
    authentication](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-rest-api-oauth-authentication/)

-   [Personal
    Token](https://confluence.atlassian.com/enterprise/using-personal-access-tokens-1026032365.html)\*

We recommend using OAuth or Personal token whenever possible, as it
provides the best security for your users and system.

### Basic authentication requirements:

-   A username and a password.

### OAuth authentication requirements:

Follow the tutorial in [Jira OAuth
documentation](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-rest-api-oauth-authentication/)
to generate the client private key, consumer key, verification code and
access token.

-   a private key, generated locally on your system.

-   A verification code, generated by Jira server.

-   The consumer key, set in the Jira server settings.

-   An access token, generated by Jira server.

### Personal access token authentication requirements:

Follow the tutorial to generate the [Personal
Token](https://confluence.atlassian.com/enterprise/using-personal-access-tokens-1026032365.html).

-   You have to set only the personal token in the `access-token`
    parameter.

## JQL

The JQL URI option is used by both consumer endpoints. Theoretically,
items like the "project key", etc. could be URI options themselves.
However, by requiring the use of JQL, the consumers become much more
flexible and powerful.

At the bare minimum, the consumers will require the following:

    jira://[type]?[required options]&jql=project=[project key]

One important thing to note is that the newIssues consumer will
automatically set the JQL as:

-   append `ORDER BY key desc` to your JQL

-   prepend `id > latestIssueId` to retrieve issues added after the
    camel route was started.

This is in order to optimize startup processing, rather than having to
index every single issue in the project.

Another note is that, similarly, the newComments consumer will have to
index every single issue **and** comment on the project. Therefore, for
large projects, it’s **vital** to optimize the JQL expression as much as
possible. For example, the JIRA Toolkit Plugin includes a
`"Number of comments"` custom field use `'"Number of comments" > 0'` in
your query. Also try to minimize based on state (`status=Open`),
increase the polling delay, etc. Example:

    jira://[type]?[required options]&jql=RAW(project=[project key] AND status in (Open, \"Coding In Progress\") AND \"Number of comments\">0)"

## Operations

See a list of required headers to set when using the Jira operations.
The author field for the producers is automatically set to the
authenticated user on the Jira side.

If any required field is not set, then an IllegalArgumentException is
throw.

There are operations that requires `id` for fields such as the issue
type, priority, transition. Check the valid `id` on your jira project as
they may differ on a jira installation and project workflow.

## AddIssue

## Component Configurations

  
|Name|Description|Default|Type|
|---|---|---|---|
|delay|Time in milliseconds to elapse for the next poll.|6000|integer|
|jiraUrl|The Jira server url, for example http://my\_jira.com:8081.||string|
|bridgeErrorHandler|Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions (if possible) occurred while the Camel consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. Important: This is only possible if the 3rd party component allows Camel to be alerted if an exception was thrown. Some components handle this internally only, and therefore bridgeErrorHandler is not possible. In other situations we may improve the Camel component to hook into the 3rd party component and make this possible for future releases. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored.|false|boolean|
|lazyStartProducer|Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing.|false|boolean|
|autowiredEnabled|Whether autowiring is enabled. This is used for automatic autowiring options (the option must be marked as autowired) by looking up in the registry to find if there is a single instance of matching type, which then gets configured on the component. This can be used for automatic configuring JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, etc.|true|boolean|
|configuration|To use a shared base jira configuration.||object|
|healthCheckConsumerEnabled|Used for enabling or disabling all consumer based health checks from this component|true|boolean|
|healthCheckProducerEnabled|Used for enabling or disabling all producer based health checks from this component. Notice: Camel has by default disabled all producer based health-checks. You can turn on producer checks globally by setting camel.health.producersEnabled=true.|true|boolean|
|accessToken|(OAuth or Personal Access Token authentication) The access token generated by the Jira server.||string|
|consumerKey|(OAuth only) The consumer key from Jira settings.||string|
