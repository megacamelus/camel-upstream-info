# Aws-bedrock-agent

**Since Camel 4.5**

**Both producer and consumer are supported**

The AWS2 Bedrock component supports invoking a supported LLM model from
[AWS Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/) service.

Prerequisites

You must have a valid Amazon Web Services developer account, and be
signed up to use Amazon Bedrock. More information is available at
[Amazon Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/).

# URI Format

    aws-bedrock-agent-runtime://label[?options]

You can append query options to the URI in the following format:

`?options=value&option2=value&...`

Required Bedrock component options

You have to provide the bedrockRuntimeClient in the Registry or your
accessKey and secretKey to access the [Amazon
Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/) service.

# Usage

## Static credentials, Default Credential Provider and Profile Credentials Provider

You have the possibility of avoiding the usage of explicit static
credentials by specifying the useDefaultCredentialsProvider option and
set it to true.

The order of evaluation for Default Credentials Provider is the
following:

-   Java system properties - `aws.accessKeyId` and `aws.secretKey`.

-   Environment variables - `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and
    `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`.

-   Web Identity Token from AWS STS.

-   The shared credentials and config files.

-   Amazon ECS container credentials - loaded from the Amazon ECS if the
    environment variable `AWS_CONTAINER_CREDENTIALS_RELATIVE_URI` is
    set.

-   Amazon EC2 Instance profile credentials.

You have also the possibility of using Profile Credentials Provider, by
specifying the useProfileCredentialsProvider option to true and
profileCredentialsName to the profile name.

Only one of static, default and profile credentials could be used at the
same time.

For more information about this you can look at [AWS credentials
documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/latest/developer-guide/credentials.html)

# Dependencies

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their pom.xml.

**pom.xml**

    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
        <artifactId>camel-aws-bedrock</artifactId>
        <version>${camel-version}</version>
    </dependency>

where `${camel-version}` must be replaced by the actual version of
Camel.

## Component Configurations

  
|Name|Description|Default|Type|
|---|---|---|---|
|configuration|Component configuration||object|
|dataSourceId|Define the Data source Id we are going to use||string|
|knowledgeBaseId|Define the Knowledge Base Id we are going to use||string|
|modelId|Define the model Id we are going to use||string|
|operation|The operation to perform||object|
|overrideEndpoint|Set the need for overriding the endpoint. This option needs to be used in combination with the uriEndpointOverride option|false|boolean|
|pojoRequest|If we want to use a POJO request as body or not|false|boolean|
|profileCredentialsName|If using a profile credentials provider, this parameter will set the profile name|false|string|
|region|The region in which Bedrock Agent client needs to work. When using this parameter, the configuration will expect the lowercase name of the region (for example, ap-east-1) You'll need to use the name Region.EU\_WEST\_1.id()||string|
|uriEndpointOverride|Set the overriding uri endpoint. This option needs to be used in combination with overrideEndpoint option||string|
|useDefaultCredentialsProvider|Set whether the Bedrock Agent client should expect to load credentials through a default credentials provider or to expect static credentials to be passed in.|false|boolean|
|useProfileCredentialsProvider|Set whether the Bedrock Agent client should expect to load credentials through a profile credentials provider.|false|boolean|
|bridgeErrorHandler|Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions (if possible) occurred while the Camel consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. Important: This is only possible if the 3rd party component allows Camel to be alerted if an exception was thrown. Some components handle this internally only, and therefore bridgeErrorHandler is not possible. In other situations we may improve the Camel component to hook into the 3rd party component and make this possible for future releases. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored.|false|boolean|
|ingestionJobId|Define the Ingestion Job Id we want to track||string|
|lazyStartProducer|Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing.|false|boolean|
|autowiredEnabled|Whether autowiring is enabled. This is used for automatic autowiring options (the option must be marked as autowired) by looking up in the registry to find if there is a single instance of matching type, which then gets configured on the component. This can be used for automatic configuring JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, etc.|true|boolean|
|bedrockAgentClient|To use an existing configured AWS Bedrock Agent client||object|
|healthCheckConsumerEnabled|Used for enabling or disabling all consumer based health checks from this component|true|boolean|
|healthCheckProducerEnabled|Used for enabling or disabling all producer based health checks from this component. Notice: Camel has by default disabled all producer based health-checks. You can turn on producer checks globally by setting camel.health.producersEnabled=true.|true|boolean|
|proxyHost|To define a proxy host when instantiating the Bedrock Agent client||string|
|proxyPort|To define a proxy port when instantiating the Bedrock Agent client||integer|
|proxyProtocol|To define a proxy protocol when instantiating the Bedrock Agent client|HTTPS|object|
|accessKey|Amazon AWS Access Key||string|
|secretKey|Amazon AWS Secret Key||string|
|sessionToken|Amazon AWS Session Token used when the user needs to assume an IAM role||string|
|trustAllCertificates|If we want to trust all certificates in case of overriding the endpoint|false|boolean|
|useSessionCredentials|Set whether the Bedrock Agent client should expect to use Session Credentials. This is useful in a situation in which the user needs to assume an IAM role for doing operations in Bedrock.|false|boolean|

|backoffMultiplier|To let the scheduled polling consumer backoff if there has been a number of subsequent idles/errors in a row.
