# Channel-adapter.md

Camel supports the [Channel
Adapter](https://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/patterns/messaging/ChannelAdapter.html)
from the [EIP patterns](#enterprise-integration-patterns.adoc).

How can you connect an application to the messaging system so that it
can send and receive messages?

Use a Channel Adapter that can access the applicationâ€™s API or data and
publish messages on a channel based on this data, and that likewise can
receive messages and invoke functionality inside the application.

The Channel Adapter is implemented in Camel by components. Each
component adapter between the systems and Camel where all details are
hidden in the implementation of the component, which allows applications
to easily send and receive data.

# Example

An application must receive messages from a Kafka topic, which can be
done by using the [Kafka](#ROOT:kafka-component.adoc) component.

One solution is to use a Camel route which consumes from the Kafka topic
which calls a bean with the data.

    from("kafka:cheese?brokers={{kafka.host}}:{{kafka.port}}"
        .to("bean:cheeseBean");

And the bean has a method which accepts the message payload as a byte
array.

    public class CheeseBean {
    
      public void receiveCheeseData(byte[] data) {
        // do something
      }
    }

You can also use [POJO consuming](#manual::pojo-consuming.adoc) with
`@Consume` annotation.

    public class CheeseBean {
      @Consume("kafka:cheese?brokers={{kafka.host}}:{{kafka.port}}")
      public void receiveCheeseData(byte[] data) {
        // do something
      }
    }
