**Since Camel 2.14**

The XML Tokenize language is a built-in language in `camel-stax`, which
is a truly XML-aware tokenizer that can be used with the
[Split](#eips:split-eip.adoc) EIP as the conventional
[Tokenize](#tokenize-language.adoc) to efficiently and effectively
tokenize XML documents.

XML Tokenize is capable of not only recognizing XML namespaces and
hierarchical structures of the document but also more efficiently
tokenizing XML documents than the conventional
[Tokenize](#tokenize-language.adoc) language.

# XML Tokenizer Options

# Example

See [Split EIP](#eips:split-eip.adoc), which has examples using the XML
Tokenize language.
