# Aws2-ec2

**Since Camel 3.1**

**Only producer is supported**

The AWS2 EC2 component supports the ability to create, run, start, stop
and terminate [AWS EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) instances.

Prerequisites

You must have a valid Amazon Web Services developer account, and be
signed up to use Amazon EC2. More information is available at [Amazon
EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/).

# URI Format

    aws2-ec2://label[?options]

You can append query options to the URI in the following format:

`?options=value&option2=value&...`

Required EC2 component options

You have to provide the amazonEc2Client in the Registry or your
accessKey and secretKey to access the [Amazon
EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) service.

# Usage

## Static credentials, Default Credential Provider and Profile Credentials Provider

You have the possibility of avoiding the usage of explicit static
credentials by specifying the useDefaultCredentialsProvider option and
set it to true.

The order of evaluation for Default Credentials Provider is the
following:

-   Java system properties - `aws.accessKeyId` and `aws.secretKey`.

-   Environment variables - `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and
    `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`.

-   Web Identity Token from AWS STS.

-   The shared credentials and config files.

-   Amazon ECS container credentials - loaded from the Amazon ECS if the
    environment variable `AWS_CONTAINER_CREDENTIALS_RELATIVE_URI` is
    set.

-   Amazon EC2 Instance profile credentials.

You have also the possibility of using Profile Credentials Provider, by
specifying the useProfileCredentialsProvider option to true and
profileCredentialsName to the profile name.

Only one of static, default and profile credentials could be used at the
same time.

For more information about this you can look at [AWS credentials
documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/latest/developer-guide/credentials.html)

# Examples

## Producer Examples

-   createAndRunInstances: this operation will create an EC2 instance
    and run it

<!-- -->

    from("direct:createAndRun")
         .setHeader(EC2Constants.IMAGE_ID, constant("ami-fd65ba94"))
         .setHeader(EC2Constants.INSTANCE_TYPE, constant(InstanceType.T2Micro))
         .setHeader(EC2Constants.INSTANCE_MIN_COUNT, constant("1"))
         .setHeader(EC2Constants.INSTANCE_MAX_COUNT, constant("1"))
         .to("aws2-ec2://TestDomain?accessKey=xxxx&secretKey=xxxx&operation=createAndRunInstances");

-   startInstances: this operation will start a list of EC2 instances

<!-- -->

    from("direct:start")
         .process(new Processor() {
                @Override
                public void process(Exchange exchange) throws Exception {
                    Collection<String> l = new ArrayList<>();
                    l.add("myinstance");
                    exchange.getIn().setHeader(AWS2EC2Constants.INSTANCES_IDS, l);
                }
            })
         .to("aws2-ec2://TestDomain?accessKey=xxxx&secretKey=xxxx&operation=startInstances");

-   stopInstances: this operation will stop a list of EC2 instances

<!-- -->

    from("direct:stop")
         .process(new Processor() {
                @Override
                public void process(Exchange exchange) throws Exception {
                    Collection<String> l = new ArrayList<>();
                    l.add("myinstance");
                    exchange.getIn().setHeader(AWS2EC2Constants.INSTANCES_IDS, l);
                }
            })
         .to("aws2-ec2://TestDomain?accessKey=xxxx&secretKey=xxxx&operation=stopInstances");

-   terminateInstances: this operation will terminate a list of EC2
    instances

<!-- -->

    from("direct:stop")
         .process(new Processor() {
                @Override
                public void process(Exchange exchange) throws Exception {
                    Collection<String> l = new ArrayList<>();
                    l.add("myinstance");
                    exchange.getIn().setHeader(AWS2EC2Constants.INSTANCES_IDS, l);
                }
            })
         .to("aws2-ec2://TestDomain?accessKey=xxxx&secretKey=xxxx&operation=terminateInstances");

## Using a POJO as body

Sometimes building an AWS Request can be complex because of multiple
options. We introduce the possibility to use a POJO as a body. In AWS
EC2 there are multiple operations you can submit, as an example for
Create and run an instance, you can do something like:

    from("direct:start")
      .setBody(RunInstancesRequest.builder().imageId("test-1").instanceType(InstanceType.T2_MICRO).build())
      .to("aws2-ec2://TestDomain?accessKey=xxxx&secretKey=xxxx&operation=createAndRunInstances&pojoRequest=true");

In this way, youâ€™ll pass the request directly without the need of
passing headers and options specifically related to this operation.

# Dependencies

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their pom.xml.

**pom.xml**

    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
        <artifactId>camel-aws2-ec2</artifactId>
        <version>${camel-version}</version>
    </dependency>

where `${camel-version}` must be replaced by the actual version of
Camel.

## Component Configurations

  
|Name|Description|Default|Type|
|---|---|---|---|
|amazonEc2Client|To use an existing configured AmazonEC2Client client||object|
|configuration|The component configuration||object|
|lazyStartProducer|Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing.|false|boolean|
|operation|The operation to perform. It can be createAndRunInstances, startInstances, stopInstances, terminateInstances, describeInstances, describeInstancesStatus, rebootInstances, monitorInstances, unmonitorInstances, createTags or deleteTags||object|

|pojoRequest|If we want to use a POJO request as body or not|false|boolean|
|region|The region in which EC2 client needs to work. When using this parameter, the configuration will expect the lowercase name of the region (for example, ap-east-1) You'll need to use the name Region.EU\_WEST\_1.id()||string|
|uriEndpointOverride|Set the overriding uri endpoint. This option needs to be used in combination with overrideEndpoint option||string|
|autowiredEnabled|Whether autowiring is enabled. This is used for automatic autowiring options (the option must be marked as autowired) by looking up in the registry to find if there is a single instance of matching type, which then gets configured on the component. This can be used for automatic configuring JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, etc.|true|boolean|
|healthCheckConsumerEnabled|Used for enabling or disabling all consumer based health checks from this component|true|boolean|
|healthCheckProducerEnabled|Used for enabling or disabling all producer based health checks from this component. Notice: Camel has by default disabled all producer based health-checks. You can turn on producer checks globally by setting camel.health.producersEnabled=true.|true|boolean|
