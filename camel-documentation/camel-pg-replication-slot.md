# Pg-replication-slot

**Since Camel 3.0**

**Only consumer is supported**

This is a component for Apache Camel that allows consuming from
PostgreSQL replication slots. The component works with PostgreSQL 10 or
later.

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their `pom.xml`
for this component:

    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
        <artifactId>camel-pg-replication-slot</artifactId>
        <version>x.x.x</version>
        <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
    </dependency>

# URI format

The pg-replication-slot component uses the following two styles of
endpoint URI notation:

    pg-replication-slot://host:port/database/slot:plugin[?parameters]

# Usage

## Tips

PostgreSQL can generate a huge number of empty transactions on certain
operations (e.g. `VACUUM`). These transactions can congest your route.
Using `greedy=true` query parameter can help with this problem. It will
help your route filter out empty transactions quickly without waiting
for the `delay`\*`timeUnit` parameter between each exchange.

The order of the messages is guaranteed, but the same message might come
more than once. So, for example, if you’re using this component to sync
data from PostgreSQL to another database, make sure your operations are
idempotent (e.g., use `UPSERT` instead of `INSERT`, etc). This will make
sure repeated messages won’t affect your system negatively.

# Examples

**Example route**

    from("pg-replication-slot://localhost:5432/finance/sync_slot:test_decoding?user={{username}}&password={{password}}&slotOptions.skip-empty-xacts=true&slotOptions.include-xids=false")
        .to("mock:result");

## Component Configurations

  
|Name|Description|Default|Type|
|---|---|---|---|
|bridgeErrorHandler|Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions (if possible) occurred while the Camel consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. Important: This is only possible if the 3rd party component allows Camel to be alerted if an exception was thrown. Some components handle this internally only, and therefore bridgeErrorHandler is not possible. In other situations we may improve the Camel component to hook into the 3rd party component and make this possible for future releases. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored.|false|boolean|
|autowiredEnabled|Whether autowiring is enabled. This is used for automatic autowiring options (the option must be marked as autowired) by looking up in the registry to find if there is a single instance of matching type, which then gets configured on the component. This can be used for automatic configuring JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, etc.|true|boolean|
|healthCheckConsumerEnabled|Used for enabling or disabling all consumer based health checks from this component|true|boolean|
|healthCheckProducerEnabled|Used for enabling or disabling all producer based health checks from this component. Notice: Camel has by default disabled all producer based health-checks. You can turn on producer checks globally by setting camel.health.producersEnabled=true.|true|boolean|

## Endpoint Configurations

  
|Name|Description|Default|Type|
|---|---|---|---|
|slot|Replication Slot name||string|
|host|Postgres host|localhost|string|
|port|Postgres port|5432|integer|
|database|Postgres database name||string|
|outputPlugin|Output plugin name||string|
|password|Postgres password||string|
|user|Postgres user|postgres|string|
|sendEmptyMessageWhenIdle|If the polling consumer did not poll any files, you can enable this option to send an empty message (no body) instead.|false|boolean|
|bridgeErrorHandler|Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions (if possible) occurred while the Camel consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. Important: This is only possible if the 3rd party component allows Camel to be alerted if an exception was thrown. Some components handle this internally only, and therefore bridgeErrorHandler is not possible. In other situations we may improve the Camel component to hook into the 3rd party component and make this possible for future releases. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored.|false|boolean|
|exceptionHandler|To let the consumer use a custom ExceptionHandler. Notice if the option bridgeErrorHandler is enabled then this option is not in use. By default the consumer will deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored.||object|
|exchangePattern|Sets the exchange pattern when the consumer creates an exchange.||object|
|pollStrategy|A pluggable org.apache.camel.PollingConsumerPollingStrategy allowing you to provide your custom implementation to control error handling usually occurred during the poll operation before an Exchange have been created and being routed in Camel.||object|
|autoCreateSlot|Auto create slot if it does not exist|true|boolean|
|slotOptions|Slot options to be passed to the output plugin.||object|
|statusInterval|Specifies the number of seconds between status packets sent back to Postgres server.|10|integer|
|backoffErrorThreshold|The number of subsequent error polls (failed due some error) that should happen before the backoffMultipler should kick-in.||integer|
|backoffIdleThreshold|The number of subsequent idle polls that should happen before the backoffMultipler should kick-in.||integer|
|backoffMultiplier|To let the scheduled polling consumer backoff if there has been a number of subsequent idles/errors in a row. The multiplier is then the number of polls that will be skipped before the next actual attempt is happening again. When this option is in use then backoffIdleThreshold and/or backoffErrorThreshold must also be configured.||integer|
|delay|Milliseconds before the next poll.|500|integer|
|greedy|If greedy is enabled, then the ScheduledPollConsumer will run immediately again, if the previous run polled 1 or more messages.|false|boolean|
|initialDelay|Milliseconds before the first poll starts.|1000|integer|
|repeatCount|Specifies a maximum limit of number of fires. So if you set it to 1, the scheduler will only fire once. If you set it to 5, it will only fire five times. A value of zero or negative means fire forever.|0|integer|
|runLoggingLevel|The consumer logs a start/complete log line when it polls. This option allows you to configure the logging level for that.|TRACE|object|
|scheduledExecutorService|Allows for configuring a custom/shared thread pool to use for the consumer. By default each consumer has its own single threaded thread pool.||object|
|scheduler|To use a cron scheduler from either camel-spring or camel-quartz component. Use value spring or quartz for built in scheduler|none|object|
|schedulerProperties|To configure additional properties when using a custom scheduler or any of the Quartz, Spring based scheduler.||object|
|startScheduler|Whether the scheduler should be auto started.|true|boolean|
|timeUnit|Time unit for initialDelay and delay options.|MILLISECONDS|object|
|useFixedDelay|Controls if fixed delay or fixed rate is used. See ScheduledExecutorService in JDK for details.|true|boolean|
