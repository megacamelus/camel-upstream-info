# Rxjava.md

**Since Camel 2.22**

RxJava based back-end for Camel’s reactive streams component.

See more details in the camel-streams-component documentation.

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their `pom.xml`
for this component:

    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
        <artifactId>camel-rxjava</artifactId>
        <version>x.x.x</version>
        <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
    </dependency>
