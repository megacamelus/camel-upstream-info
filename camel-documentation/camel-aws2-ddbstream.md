# Aws2-ddbstream

**Since Camel 3.1**

**Only consumer is supported**

The AWS2 DynamoDB Stream component supports receiving messages from
Amazon DynamoDB Stream service.

Prerequisites

You must have a valid Amazon Web Services developer account, and be
signed up to use Amazon DynamoDB Streams. More information are available
at [AWS DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/)

# URI Format

    aws2-ddbstream://table-name[?options]

The stream needs to be created prior to it being used.  
You can append query options to the URI in the following format,
?options=value\&option2=value\&â€¦

Required DynamoDBStream component options

You have to provide the DynamoDbStreamsClient in the Registry with
proxies and relevant credentials configured.

# Sequence Numbers

You can provide a literal string as the sequence number or provide a
bean in the registry. An example of using the bean would be to save your
current position in the change feed and restore it on Camel startup.

It is an error to provide a sequence number that is greater than the
largest sequence number in the describe-streams result, as this will
lead to the AWS call returning an HTTP 400.

# Usage

## Static credentials, Default Credential Provider and Profile Credentials Provider

You have the possibility of avoiding the usage of explicit static
credentials, by specifying the useDefaultCredentialsProvider option and
set it to true.

The order of evaluation for Default Credentials Provider is the
following:

-   Java system properties - aws.accessKeyId and aws.secretKey

-   Environment variables - AWS\_ACCESS\_KEY\_ID and
    AWS\_SECRET\_ACCESS\_KEY.

-   Web Identity Token from AWS STS.

-   The shared credentials and config files.

-   Amazon ECS container credentials - loaded from the Amazon ECS if the
    environment variable AWS\_CONTAINER\_CREDENTIALS\_RELATIVE\_URI is
    set.

-   Amazon EC2 Instance profile credentials.

You have also the possibility of using Profile Credentials Provider, by
specifying the useProfileCredentialsProvider option to true and
profileCredentialsName to the profile name.

Only one of static, default and profile credentials could be used at the
same time.

For more information about this you can look at [AWS credentials
documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/latest/developer-guide/credentials.html)

## Coping with Downtime

### AWS DynamoDB Streams outage of less than 24 hours

The consumer will resume from the last seen sequence number (as
implemented for
[CAMEL-9515](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CAMEL-9515)), so you
should receive a flood of events in quick succession, as long as the
outage did not also include DynamoDB itself.

## AWS DynamoDB Streams outage of more than 24 hours

Given that AWS only retain 24 hours worth of changes, you will have
missed change events no matter what mitigations are in place.

## Message Body

The Message body is instance of
"software.amazon.awssdk.services.dynamodb.model.Record", for more
information about it, have a look at the [related
javadoc](https://sdk.amazonaws.com/java/api/latest/software/amazon/awssdk/services/dynamodb/model/Record.html)

# Dependencies

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their pom.xml.

**pom.xml**

    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
        <artifactId>camel-aws2-ddb</artifactId>
        <version>${camel-version}</version>
    </dependency>

where `${camel-version}` must be replaced by the actual version of
Camel.

## Component Configurations

  
|Name|Description|Default|Type|
|---|---|---|---|
|bridgeErrorHandler|Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions (if possible) occurred while the Camel consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. Important: This is only possible if the 3rd party component allows Camel to be alerted if an exception was thrown. Some components handle this internally only, and therefore bridgeErrorHandler is not possible. In other situations we may improve the Camel component to hook into the 3rd party component and make this possible for future releases. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored.|false|boolean|
|configuration|The component configuration||object|
|maxResultsPerRequest|Maximum number of records that will be fetched in each poll||integer|
|overrideEndpoint|Set the need for overidding the endpoint. This option needs to be used in combination with uriEndpointOverride option|false|boolean|
|region|The region in which DDBStreams client needs to work||string|
|streamIteratorType|Defines where in the DynamoDB stream to start getting records. Note that using FROM\_START can cause a significant delay before the stream has caught up to real-time.|FROM\_LATEST|object|

|amazonDynamoDbStreamsClient|Amazon DynamoDB client to use for all requests for this endpoint||object|
|autowiredEnabled|Whether autowiring is enabled.

This can be used for automatic configuring JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, etc.|true|boolean|
|healthCheckConsumerEnabled|Used for enabling or disabling all consumer based health checks from this component|true|boolean|
|healthCheckProducerEnabled|Used for enabling or disabling all producer based health checks from this component. Notice: Camel has by default disabled all producer based health-checks. You can turn on producer checks globally by setting camel.health.producersEnabled=true.|true|boolean|
