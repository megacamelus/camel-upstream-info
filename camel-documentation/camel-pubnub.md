# Pubnub

**Since Camel 2.19**

**Both producer and consumer are supported**

Camel PubNub component can be used to communicate with the
[PubNub](https://www.pubnub.com/) data stream network for connected
devices. This component uses pubnub [java
library](https://github.com/pubnub/java).

Use cases include:

-   Chat rooms: Sending and receiving messages

-   Locations and Connected cars: dispatching taxi cabs

-   Smart sensors: Receiving data from a sensor for data visualizations

-   Health: Monitoring heart rate from a patientâ€™s wearable device

-   Multiplayer games

-   Interactive media: audience-participating voting system

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their `pom.xml`
for this component:

    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
        <artifactId>camel-pubnub</artifactId>
        <version>x.x.x</version>
        <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
    </dependency>

# URI format

    pubnub:channel[?options]

Where **channel** is the PubNub channel to publish or subscribe to.

# Usage

## Message body

The message body can contain any JSON serializable data, including
Objects, Arrays, Integers, and Strings. Message data should not contain
special Java V4 classes or functions as these will not serialize. String
content can include any single-byte or multibyte UTF-8.

Object serialization when sending is done automatically. Pass the full
object as the message payload. PubNub will take care of object
serialization.

When receiving the message body uses objects provided by the PubNub API.

# Examples

## Publishing events

Default operation when producing. The following snippet publishes the
event generated by PojoBean to the channel iot.

    from("timer:mytimer")
        // generate some data as POJO.
        .bean(PojoBean.class)
        .to("pubnub:iot?publishKey=mypublishKey");

## Fire events aka BLOCKS Event Handlers

See [blocks catalog](https://www.pubnub.com/blocks-catalog/) for all
kinds of serverless functions that can be invoked. Example of
geolocation lookup

    from("timer:geotimer")
        .process(exchange -> exchange.getIn().setBody(new Foo("bar", "TEXT")))
        .to("pubnub:eon-maps-geolocation-input?operation=fire&publishKey=mypubkey&subscribeKey=mysubkey");
    
    from("pubnub:eon-map-geolocation-output?subscribeKey=mysubkey)
        // geolocation output will be logged here
        .log("${body}");

## Subscribing to events

The following snippet listens for events on the iot channel. If you can
add the option withPresence, you will also receive channel Join, Leave
asf events.

    from("pubnub:iot?subscribeKey=mySubscribeKey")
        .log("${body}")
        .to("mock:result");

## Performing operations

-   `herenow`: obtain information about the current state of a channel
    including a list of unique user-ids currently subscribed to the
    channel and the total occupancy count of the channel:

<!-- -->

    from("direct:control")
        .to("pubnub:myChannel?publishKey=mypublishKey&subscribeKey=mySubscribeKey&operation=herenow")
        .to("mock:result");

-   `wherenow`: obtain information about the current list of channels to
    which a uuid is subscribed:

<!-- -->

    from("direct:control")
        .to("pubnub:myChannel?publishKey=mypublishKey&subscribeKey=mySubscribeKey&operation=wherenow&uuid=spyonme")
        .to("mock:result");

-   `setstate`: used to set key/value pairs specific to a subscriber
    uuid:

<!-- -->

    from("direct:control")
        .bean(StateGenerator.class)
        .to("pubnub:myChannel?publishKey=mypublishKey&subscribeKey=mySubscribeKey&operation=setstate&uuid=myuuid");

-   `gethistory`: Fetches historical messages of a channel:

<!-- -->

    from("direct:control")
        .to("pubnub:myChannel?publishKey=mypublishKey&subscribeKey=mySubscribeKey&operation=gethistory");

There are a couple of examples in the test directory that show some of
the PubNub features. They require a PubNub account, from where you can
obtain a publish/subscribe key.

The example PubNubSensorExample already contains a subscription key
provided by PubNub, so this is ready to run without an account. The
example illustrates the PubNub component subscribing to an infinite
stream of sensor data.

## Component Configurations

  
|Name|Description|Default|Type|
|---|---|---|---|
|configuration|The component configurations||object|
|uuid|UUID to be used as a device identifier, a default UUID is generated if not passed.||string|
|bridgeErrorHandler|Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions (if possible) occurred while the Camel consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. Important: This is only possible if the 3rd party component allows Camel to be alerted if an exception was thrown. Some components handle this internally only, and therefore bridgeErrorHandler is not possible. In other situations we may improve the Camel component to hook into the 3rd party component and make this possible for future releases. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored.|false|boolean|
|withPresence|Also subscribe to related presence information|false|boolean|
|lazyStartProducer|Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing.|false|boolean|
|operation|The operation to perform. PUBLISH: Default. Send a message to all subscribers of a channel. FIRE: allows the client to send a message to BLOCKS Event Handlers. These messages will go directly to any Event Handlers registered on the channel. HERENOW: Obtain information about the current state of a channel including a list of unique user-ids currently subscribed to the channel and the total occupancy count. GETSTATE: Used to get key/value pairs specific to a subscriber uuid. State information is supplied as a JSON object of key/value pairs SETSTATE: Used to set key/value pairs specific to a subscriber uuid GETHISTORY: Fetches historical messages of a channel.||string|
|autowiredEnabled|Whether autowiring is enabled. This is used for automatic autowiring options (the option must be marked as autowired) by looking up in the registry to find if there is a single instance of matching type, which then gets configured on the component. This can be used for automatic configuring JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, etc.|true|boolean|
|authKey|If Access Manager is utilized, client will use this authKey in all restricted requests.||string|
|cipherKey|If cipher is passed, all communications to/from PubNub will be encrypted.||string|
|publishKey|The publish key obtained from your PubNub account. Required when publishing messages.||string|
|secretKey|The secret key used for message signing.||string|
|secure|Use SSL for secure transmission.|true|boolean|
|subscribeKey|The subscribe key obtained from your PubNub account. Required when subscribing to channels or listening for presence events||string|
